Why it matters
Every “missing” day wasn’t skipped—it was a chance to dive deeper into best practices:

Advanced CSS like Grid, Flexbox, media queries.

JS fundamentals: event handling, DOM manipulation.

Accessibility & performance optimizations.

State management and responsive React patterns.

Peer reviews, testing, and UI refinements.

Each day was a building block toward becoming a thoughtful, responsive-front-end developer—balancing design, functionality, and user experience.
